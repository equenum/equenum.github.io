## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, fellow code wizard!

I'm Egor Quenum, a software engineer and a Homelab enthusiast. When I am not developing enterprise web solutions or teaching ASP.NET, I explore new things, write fun side projects, and tinker with hardware, all while documenting my journey [here](https://equenum.github.io/). I invite you to follow along, learn something new, share feedback and ideas, and hopefully have a bit of fun along the way! ðŸš€

The website is based on Jekyll static pages with [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) and hosted on GitHub pages.
